# Allocaur
a text based, kick butt, sci-fi, story game. until full release, refrain judgement and be patient.
this game was written in Java, and therefore must be run using the JDK and JVM compiler to play. im fairly new to java, and im working on 
a way for this game to be played as a stand-alone file, instead of a java package and folder. but i'll figure it out as i go. 
full versions of the game will be signified as such in this README in later edits.
